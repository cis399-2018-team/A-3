Describe how you find the public IP address of a given instance using the EC2 console. (The public IP address may change whenever an instance is stopped and restarted.)

The 9th Column in the EC2 console has the public IP addresses of an instance.
When an instance is selected, the instances description window also has the public IP address, located in the second row of the second column.
