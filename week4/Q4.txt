Describe the results of testing your load balancer when you shut down one, then both, back-end instances, and when you restore them.

If we shut down one of the instances it still serves the expected webpage.

If we shut down both back-end instances, the webpage is no longer accessible, and it gives the error code: a-3-lb-993058420.us-west-2.elb.amazonaws.com is currently unable to handle this request.
HTTP ERROR 503

If after shutting down both instances, we reboot one of them, the webpage is accessible again.
Likewise, after turning the second instance back on the webpage is still accessible.
